      <p class="calibre7">Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p class="calibre7">Contains spoilers for <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126" rel="nofollow"><i class="calibre8">Worth the Candle</i></a> up to chapter 56.</p><p class="calibre7">This is a side story recounting the group's first session of Arches, a tabletop game created by Juniper partly to demonstrate to the group what tabletop roleplaying games are actually like. The rules for Arches (and stats the characters are using) can be found in chapter 2 of this work, though they're mostly explained in this story. This was mostly an experiment in trying to make people playing a roleplaying game entertaining to read, as well as writing larger group conversations and a little bit of character work. (A fair amount of it was written contemporaneously with ch 56.)</p></blockquote>
