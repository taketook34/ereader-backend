      <p class="calibre7">Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p class="calibre7">A teenager struggling after the death of his best friend finds himself in a fantasy world - one which seems to be an amalgamation of every Dungeons and Dragons campaign they ever played together. Now he's stuck trying to find the answers to why he's there and what this world is trying to say. The most terrifying answer might be that this world is an expression of the person he was back on Earth.</p><p class="calibre7">Note: Up there at the top, it says "Creator Chose Not To Use Archive Warnings". This is very distinct from "No Archive Warnings Apply". The warning that there are no warnings is your only warning; do with it what you will.</p><p class="calibre7">This story is also <a href="https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle" rel="nofollow">cross-posted on Royal Road.</a> and <a href="https://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-1/" rel="nofollow">my website</a>.</p></blockquote>
